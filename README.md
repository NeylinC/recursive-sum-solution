> Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.
> 
> Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.
> Example
>     16  -->  1 + 6 = 7

This is my solution to the "Sum of Digits / Digital Root" problem from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541c8630095125aba6000c00).
